IEnumerable:
The IEnumerable interface is the base for all the non-generic collections that can be enumerated.

It exposes a single method GetEnumerator(). This method returns a reference to yet another interface System.Collections.IEnumerator.

The IEnumerator interface in turn provides the ability to iterate through a collection by using the methods MoveNext() and Reset(), and the property Current.
